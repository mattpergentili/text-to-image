this is a basic project made with vanilla js and OpenAI's APIs.

## Quickstart

- download the project or clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- create a `.env` file and store inside it your api key (create the key in the OpenAI website, api section)
- open the terminal and run `node server.js` and `npm run dev`

### Enjoy :)
